Fake IMDB with Thymleaf and Spring boot üçÉ

== Adoc Notes
. In form if there are multiple buttons then you need to specifiy
the types of the button otherwise the buttons will be treated
as submit buttons. for submit use type=submit. for other buttons
use type=button.

. But the best solution is `<a th:href="@{/home}" class="btn btn-success">Go back to Home</a>`

. In JS if you use findElementById it will return single instance
and you can use all the attributes and operation of html element
in it. But if you use findElementByClassNames it will return
a array of HTMLELEMENTS then you will have to find your
desired element and manupulate it. Mostly by [0] index.


. You can reset form data using `<input type="reset" value="Reset">`
But it won't always work.

. Thymleaf can be used to dynamically append class using
`<div class="alert alert-warning alert-dismissible fade" th:classappend="${message} ? show : d-none" role="alert">`
the result will be `alert alert-warning alert-dismissible fade show` or `alert alert-warning alert-dismissible fade` based on `th:classappend="${message} ? show : d-none"`

. The code for message showing in a thymleaf page is
[source,xml]
.filename.xml
----
    <div class="alert alert-warning alert-dismissible fade" th:classappend="${message} ? show : d-none" role="alert">
        <strong th:text="${message}">Holy guacamole!</strong>
        <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close">
            <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
        </button>
    </div>
----


. form top `<form action="#" th:action="@{/add-movie}" th:object="${movie}" method="POST">`
. To get form data from field with name `th:field="*{name}`
. Best link reference thymeleaf `https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/articles/standardurlsyntax.html`

=== Questions I had making this project and their answers:

. Is there any Template Inheritance system in Thymeleaf that we have in Django?
.. No. We don't have template inheritance. Thymeleaf doesn't follows the hirarchical structure. If you want to do something like that, you have much powerful Fragments in thymleaf.
. Is there any Intillij IDEA Support for thymleaf? Can I select a variable and see where it is comming from? 
.. No. The view and model are loosely coupled. Super loosely. The variables you declare in the template have no knowing which controller will supply that variable. 3-4 controllers could supply that. Though it is a much needed feature. It has it's own reason not to get the light. 
. How do you put variable inside running paragraph?
.. Easy peasy. Just put `${variable}` inside dummy. And if you feel fancy. You can write <span th:remove="tag" th:text="inserted text">I will be replaced</span>
. What is redirect and how is it difference from direcly calling a template?
.. Redirect actually forces your browser to go to a certain URL. If that URL has a controller attached to it. That controller will be called. On the other hand if you suplly a single template, it will depend on the controller that supplies it. Let's say you added a student, and you want to show the student list after you added the student. If you call the student-list.html template from the add-student controller, the template will have no data to show as the add-student controller only adds the student. So it sends or redirects the response to the controller of student-list so that the responsible controller can take proper action and supply the list of students to show properly. 
. How to re-indent code in IntilliJ?
.. `ctrl+alt+l`
